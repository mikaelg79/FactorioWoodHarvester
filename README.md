Changelog:
0.0.10: Fixed recipe items amounts incorrectly defined as strings instead of ints.
0.0.9:  Fixed an error message when the mod was added to an existing game.
0.0.8:  Fixed the recipe sorting, now sorts after Pumpjacks in the extraction machine subcategory.
        Harvester now starts cutting trees closest to itself and works its way out.
